#### Project Motivation

This project is the Blog Post for the Data Scientist Nandegree Program from Udacity. I choose to work on a data set that contains TMDb movie data. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).The data Contains Information About The Budget, Revenue , the user rating, vote, genre and release year for each movie and more from 1960 to 2015 .

I would like to find intresting patterns in this dataset using paython packges pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplotlib in this analysis.

Business Understanding
We are interested to answer the following four questions:

Which genres are most popular ?
Which genres are the most highest revenue?
Is the movie rating influence the revenue?
What other properties reflect the movies that have high revenues?



### Dataset Description:

The original dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv 

The data is contained on 21 variable and 10,000 row. 
The data Contains Information About The Budget, Revenue , the user rating, vote, genre and release year for each movie and more from 1960 to 2015 .
